<h3>A Note on Learning</h3>
<p>This course is an attempt to not only introduce you to programming, but to strip away the mystery behind how the Internet works, how files are created, how websites are stored and served, and to introduce to you the development process behind most web apps and projects. We will use tools and systems that you will come across in most newsrooms today. The goal is to make you familiar with the underlying processes so that as these tools inevitably evolve and change over time you will have the base understanding that will allow you to adapt to these changes.</p>

<h3>The Final Project</h3>
<p>You will create, at minimum, a one-page project that will by the end of the first five weeks have the basic artchitecture and design set up, and by the end the of semester have multiple interactions handled via javascript. The first week will be dedicated to proposing your project. Start simple.</p>

<h2>HTML/CSS Weeks 1-5</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1 Introduction, Tools, What is a Website? (2/2):</strong> We introduce the class, go over class objectives and why coding is important in journalism. Then we will make sure everyone has the programs necessary for the next 15 weeks downloaded and accounts et up (Dropbox, Sublime, Slack). The last part of the class will focus on how website files get served and basic page setup.</li>
  <li><strong>2 HTML & Wireframes (2/9):</strong> Introduction of HTML as a markup language, how to write it and common tags needed for starting a page. The last part of class will be a lab hour getting students set up on GitHub, where they will commit their work.</li>
  <li><strong>3 CSS: & Design Basics (2/18*):</strong> Introduce how to use CSS and how to write it and include it on a page. We also introduce the console and how to inspect sites and check changes. The last part of class focuses on design basics to help get students started on envisioning their final project.</li>
  <li><strong>4 Positioning (2/23):</strong> Today we go over the various properties that control the positioning of elements on your page. The second part of class will be a workshop where we students’ final projects architected on the page.</li>
  <li><strong>5 SEO (3/2):</strong> A quick lesson on meta tags and how they, in addition to URLs, figure into SEO performance. The second part of class is more workshop time to get students close to finishing their final project.</li>
  <li><strong>FINAL PROJECT:</strong> A one-page story told via various mediums (text, audio, video, photos, data, etc.) that is fully conceived, designed and build for the web. <strong>DUE: Monday 3/9</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>JavaScript/JQuery Weeks 6-15</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>6 What is JavaScript? (3/9):</strong> Discussing JavaScript as a language, how it was created and it’s current place in modern web technology. We will go over what it is used for and how it can be incorporated into journalism projects. We will also discuss its relationship to the Document Object Model and how to add it to the students’ websites. </li>
  <li><strong>7 Variables, Functions & Methods (3/16):</strong> We will go over some basic JavaScript grammar and syntax and cover how to create and use variables. Moving on, we’ll go over the basic structure for functions and how to create custom methods. In the process we will discuss Object-Oriented Programming and how JavaScript can be used in this manner.</li>
  <li><strong>8 Arrays & Objects (3/23):</strong> Continuing with basic JavaScript vocabulary, we cover various ways of storing data and variables for use in our code.</li>
  <li><strong>9 Introduction to JQuery (3/30):</strong> Discussing the difference between JavaScript and jQuery and how jQuery methods can be used to complete JavaScript tasks in a much more efficient way. We will download the jQuery library, add it to the students’ websites, and practice some basic methods.</li>
  <li><strong>10 Plugins & Workshop (4/13):</strong> This week we will go over how jQuery plugins work and how they can quickly be added to a website to enhance interactivity. Students will find a plugin they want to add to their site and we will spend workshop time configuring them to each students’ website.</li>
  <li><strong>11 Loops (4/20):</strong> We will discuss how to loop through data in order to act on multiple objects in both native JavaScript and in jQuery.</li>
  <li><strong>12 Workshop (4/27):</strong> Pick a plugin to add to your final project. Think about functionality you want your project to have.</li>
  <li><strong>13 Data Types & AJAX (5/4):</strong> We will discuss two of the most popular ways of storing data - XML and JSON - and how to use AJAX to grab data and display it on our page. We will write our own data files as well as find publicly available data to use.</li>
  <li><strong>14 Workshop (5/11):</strong> Students will come up with a project or feature for their website that requires JavaScript and will spend a workshop writing the functions and finding the plugins they will need to complete it during this workshop period.</li>
  <li><strong>FINAL PROJECT:</strong> Using the project created in the HTML/CSS module, students will write either native javascript, jQuery or use plugins to add at least two types of functionality to their project. <strong>DUE: Monday 5/18</strong></li>
