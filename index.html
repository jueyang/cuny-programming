  <h1>Welcome.</h1>
  <h2>CUNY Programming for Journalists</h2>
  <p>A module course taught by Meghan Louttit. This course is split into two modules. The first is a five-week introduction to HTML and CSS. The second is a ten-week introduction to JavaScript and JQuery. You will not leave this class a programmer (that takes time). You will leave this class with the basic knowledge to become a programmer, communicate effectively to other technologists you will inevitably work with, use tools to build your own projects, understand the role of design in journalism and as a better problem-solver, communicator and thinker. These are all good things.</p>
